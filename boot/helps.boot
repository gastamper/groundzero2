-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

Bug reports --
    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,
    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington
    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs

-1 DONATE base hq headquarters~

Yer team HEADQUARTERS is located at one of the corners of level 0.  You may
donate items to yer team with the DONATE command. This will put the items
in yer HEADQUARTERS where other members of yer team can get them. There is,
however, a limit of how many items may be donated at once.

-1 blindness flares blind~

&WEuthenasia&n &XCOMMBADGE&n: '&Wyou must circle a dead cat
 three times,  and sprinkle the blood of a frog onto your left nipple..then 
shall the blindness go away&n'

When you get shot by a flare gun or hit a flare mine, you get blinded.
Blind's duration is random, and can last from 1 second to 30 minutes or 
more.  If you get blinded, you should run to somewhere safe like your 
hq if you can, and wait it out,or if after 10 minutes you're still blind, 
you could frag yourself after dropping your eq somewhere where you can 
find it again.
~

-1 mobs mobiles npcs~
Despite being a PK game, GZ is populated with a small number of mobiles to
make the game more interesting.  These mobiles exist for theme or scenario
purposes (e.g., team-mobiles exist to support the team-based PK theme;
General Pataki exists to guard the big red button).  Scenario or theme based
mobiles can change depending upon the game scenario.

Some mobiles--especially ones on lower-levels!--are worth more than one
kill.  Some mobiles--particularly the variety created during the game by
players (troopers, droids, turrets)--are worth less than one kill.
~


-1 HINTS~
The most important thing a newbie finds out when starting GZ is that you're
going to die.  Don't quit because you get slaughtered a few times.  There's
a learning curve, true, and sometimes one team is kicking ass.  Don't worry. 
Things change.  Rounds end.  You'll get better as time goes on.  Most
newbies start off with a few kills against easy mobiles and a few dozen
deaths.  Everyone who plays GZ now went through this stage at one point as
they adjusted and learned.

You don't normally need to use the KILL command for anything.  When you
start, KILL ALL is turned on for you.  With KILL ALL on, you'll shoot anyone
not on your team provided you have a loaded weapon and they're in range.

In addition, there's no FLEE command.  Combat in GZ is not treated as an
intrusive secondary system.  Since it is the main focus of the game, it is
seemlessly integrated with the game.  If you're being shot, you can run away
by just moving as per usual.  A good place to hide is your team's base.  The
bases are normally in the southwest and northeast corners, one for each of
the two regularly active teams.  In some scenarios there may be as many as 4
active teams, with four bases in each of the corners.  Traditionally, the
two active teams are BRAVO and ALPHA, with BRAVO's base being in the
southwest corner (0, 0) and ALPHA's in the northeast corner (20, 20).  The
guardians stand on the bases, pushing away people not on the same team who
walk onto them, as well as shooting them with a grenade launcher.  A
guardian's range is usually 4 squares.  Thus, if you're on BRAVO team you
should stay well-away from the ALPHA base, as the guardians are pretty mean.

Sometimes not even your base will save you!  Each base starts with a
guardian to protect it.  The guardian is big and strong.  There's no way a
player can stand in and fight with the guardian one-on-one.  However,
guardians can be killed.  Either through repeated booming, using a tank, or
standing outside his range with a long-range weapon.  Since the guardian has
to stand at your base to protect against other teams gaining entry, he
cannot defend against these tactics.  Without your help, the guardian will
die and nothing will stop the other team from getting into your base.  This
means that donations and hiding players are not safe there.

The map is autogenerated at each boot.  It's usually the same size (21x21,
with the southwest being (0, 0), and the northeast being (20, 20)), but the
exits are different.  Every square within the map is reachable in some way,
but there are times when certain squares are difficult to reach (because
they have only one entrance).  The perimeter of the map is always connected
to adjacent perimeter squares.  That is, you can travel completely around
the map's edges.  However, this isn't always a good idea.  Not only do you
risk running into the other team's guardian if it's alive, but often times
people lay mines on the perimeter to foil opponents using it to move quickly
across the map.

-1 TACTICS~
So you need a few hints?  Some tactics to get you started?  Are you finding
more and more that you suck more than a Stephen Hawking wet dream?  (Do you
have any idea what the hell that means?)

Have no fear!  Tireg's tactics are here.

There are a couple of chapters so far, with more to come (eventually):

  * TACTIC1 - In which you learn how to reduce your opponents to
              smithereens.
  * TACTIC2 - In which you learn the ins and outs of ye' old guns and
              armor.

See "HELP NEWBIE" for beginner information.
See "HELP FAQ" for the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).
See "HELP HINTS" for a few quick hints to get you started.
See "HELP TIPS" for a few player-submitted tips on playing.

-1 TACTIC1 BOOMING~
&RTireg's Tactics&n; &cPart 1.&n  Booming 101&n

Definition of '&YBoom&n':
&rn. 1.loud, deep, hollow sound 2.sparhinged at one end 3.flurry of 
business or industrial activity. -v.i. 4.make a booming noise 
5. enjoy a boom, as a town or industry&n

	&cCuth&n says '&Mboom is when you freakin blow someone up christ&n'


    Never underestimate the value of &GEXPLOSIVES&n.  If you're 
getting spam killed or outgunned, &RBOOM them&n.

			&RTactic 1&n: &XExp from Nowhere&n
    Gather enough exp, then grab an explode_on_contact explosive, 
such as a molotov cocktail or a chemical bomb, then find your victim's 
location. Try to get a wall in between you and your victim and pull 
all quickly, then spam throw exp <direction> quickly and run.  
The explode_on_contact explosive should set off the other explosives 
when it lands, causing a very fast and painful explosion.  
This tactic works great against the Postal Worker and mobs that follow.

			&RTactic 2&n: &XMining&n
    Gather some exp and a mine, such as a claymore or stun.  Then weaken the
explosives by throwing them to another room, or blowing up another explosive
in an adjacent room.  Then either mine popular places that your victims go to:
1. Depots,  (Be sure to grab or donate all the hyposprays first, as they heal
             when they explode)
2. Rooms adjacent to enemy bases, (if there's a guard)
3. In enemy bases, (if you manage to get inside)
4. Other rooms frequented by your enemies; second down, big red button...

			&RTactic 3&n: &XFollow Boom&n
    Good to do this when you've got no gear and your victim moves alot.  
Works even better if you have dual flare gun/taser w/stun cartridges.  
Gather some exp, then type 'where' to find the area of your victim.  
Then type 'track <victim>' and follow them until you're their area.  
Then keep tracking 'til you're sure you're near them, and 'pull all'.  
As quickly as you can, move into their room and if your victim moves away, 
keep following them, until the explosives go off.  If you've gathered 
enough explosives, you will both go *BOOM*. :)

			&RTactic 4&n: &XFind & Drop/Throw Boom&n
    This tactic also works great right after you've died.  Even better 
if you have explode_on_contact explosives (mentioned above).  Scroll up and
find the location you got killed at, especially if you had some nice gear.  
Then walk there, but gather exp on your way, or head to your base, 
gather exp, then head to the coords. When you come close, type 'where' 
to see if they're still there, then 'track' til you're close and 'pull all'.
Next, if you want to throw the exp, go to a room right next to your victim 
(who is still probably looting your corpse if you're fast) and spam 
'throw exp <direction>'.  After all the exp is gone, RUN!!  Or if you want
to drop the exp, just walk into the room your victim's in and type 
'drop all.exp' then RUN!!  It's good to wait a few ticks before you 
drop though, so you're victim has less reaction time before the explosives
go off.  The throwing tactic also works great if you throw the exp onto 
an adjacent room to your victim, because they won't know what hit 'em :)


&YHINT&n:  &RUsing maps&n
    Inside every HQ and live tank is a map of level 0.  
Each little . is a room. The lowest and farthest to the left one is 0, 0.  
Maps help with several things, such as location of tanks, 
naping players/mobs, and finding players/mobs.

Players and mobs are shown on the map using the first letter of the team
they belong to in the color of that team.  A player's letter is capitalized,
while a mobiles is lowercase.  For instance, a BRAVO player might appear as
&BB&n, while a BRAVO mob would appear as &bb&n.

Key:
&gG&n = poison gas
&RF&n = fire
V = vehicle tank/mech (Note: Live vehicles are shown as mobs.)
&XD&n = darkness
. = empty room



&RTactic 5&n: &XEvac Boom!&n
    This is one of the hardest but BEST booms you can perform.  
First, gather some exp and an evac radio.  Then go inside your hq and 
type 'look map' to find the location of your victim.  Keep looking 
at the map to see if they're still there. Then if they stay in a room, 
pull all, leave, and if you think they'll be staying in a room long, 
wait a few seconds.  (I suggest 5 to 6 tickings)  Then 'use evac
<coordinates>' and when you land, drop all.exp and RUN, follow them, 
or throw the exp if they've moved a room or two away.

&RTactic 6&n: &XBooming Still Mobs&n (such as Pataki)
    Ever wanted to know how people boom mobs?  Well here's how: 
First, gather as much exp as you can, until your inventory is STUFFED
with 'em. Then go to a room kitty corner to your victim's room.  
(If they're at 0 0, go to 1 1, ect) Then you have two choices:  
If you want to do a big boom and probably die along with it,
pull all.exp and go to a room adjacent to your victim.  
Then start throwing the exp until you die, or just wait until you die.  
If you don't want to die, then either pull one at a time, go to a room 
adjacent to them, throw the exp to their room, then run back and keep 
doing that, healing in between, or pull all.exp, go to the  room adjacent
to them, drop all.exp, and RUN.  You could also pull the exp and just
throw it all to the adjacent room then RUN, which would be a little less
risky.
Note: Exp that goes off in an adjacent room doesn't do as much 
damage as exp that went off directly in the room.

Part 2 will come soon..

-1 STORM~

Sorry, dude.. &RStorm&n is beyond your help.

0 rules~
&WSatori&n says '&usThe rules are: (1) No spamming.  (2) No multiplaying.  (3) No being annoying just to
be annoying.  Don't be a jackass.&n'

Here at &RG&XZ&n, you are allowed do alot of stuff that would get you banned on
any other mud.  We do, however, have a few rules so here are the 6 Commandments
that you should follow:

&Y1.&n &WThou shalt not spam.&n  Spamming is a Very Bad Thing(tm).  Spamming
   any player or any channel will not be tolerated.  Spammers will be dealt
   with very severely.

&Y2.&n &WThou shalt not multiplay.&n  There will be no multiple logins or
   helping your own characters with other characters of your own.  This rule
   also applies to spam-creating.  You can have more than 1 character, as long
   as its reasonable. &RLink-Dead characters count as online characters.&n  You
   aren't allowed to use your alts to switch teams, even if you deem it a noble
   endeavor.  It's not allowed.  Don't do it.

&Y3.&n &WThou shalt not cheat.&n  Ever.  Not on your girlfriend, your wife,
   or your favorite post-apocalyptic PK mud.  If you need to be told this it's
   it's a wonder you've lived for so long.  This includes abusing a bug.  If 
   you find a bug you can report it for a reward.  If you abuse a bug you will
   be dealt with severely.

&Y4.&n &WThou shalt not create characters for banned sites.&n  Self explanatory.
   If you create a char for a banned site YOUR site will be banned.

&Y5.&n &WDon't complain.&n  Don't ask favors from the ADMIN.  Continuous
   whining and nagging will not be tolerated.  If you think something is
   fucked up or wrong, write a note about it and a suggestion on what could
   be done.

&Y6.&n &WChanges to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, 
   and may be done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity.&n

~


0 scan track where~

SYNTAX: scan
SYNTAX: track <player_name>
SYNTAX: where
SYNTAX: where <plsyer_name>

Scan tells you the characters that are near you four squares in the cardinal
directions.

Track tells you the general direction that another player in the game is
relative to you.  (ie this allows you to TRACK them!  Hence the name! =)  )
Conveniently every player in the game has a transmission beacon attached to 
them that allows any other player to tell their general direction relative
to that player.  Unfortunately, being on differrent levels or in a tank
interferes with the signal so it can't be used ALL the time.

Where gives the general area that players around you are in.
You may specify a particular character with this command and it will only 
list their name and general location.
~

0 DEATH DEAD DYING~
On this MUD when you die, you get transferred back to the safe room,
where you started at, with partial hp.  You'll probably die a lot on
your first tries, so don't get frustrated or angry when you die, its
just a part of the game, and equipment is pretty easy to find.
Well what happened to your stuff?
You don't leave behind a corpse, as with most MUDs, but the stuff
that you had can be found at the room you died, on the ground, unless
you got killed by explosives or fire.  In that case, your stuff might
have been 'fragged' (destroyed).  When your stuff is destroyed, each
item you had drops into a different random room on the battlefield.
Also note that since your stuff is just laying on the ground, it is
free for others to take, so if your stuff isn't there and you didn't
get killed by explosives or fire, someone probably took it.
But as I said, equipment and items are pretty easy to find on the ground,
so don't sweat it if you die.
~


-1 PUSH ROLL~

Syntax :
	push	<player_name> <direction>
	push	<obj_name> <direction>

You can PUSH a person who is in the same room as yourself in any given
direction (assuming there is an EXIT in this direction) with this command.

PUSH may also be used on barrels to move them around and create really,
really big explosions.

Syntax :
        roll    <obj_name> <direction>

You can ROLL certain objects, like barrels, as far as they can go in a
single direction with the ROLL command.  Be careful, though: when they hit
walls, they can explode.

-1 NEWBIE~
&X_.,-'&``-,._.,-'&``-,._.,-'&``-&n| &WNEWBIE INFORMATION &n|&X-'&``-,._.,-'&``-,._.,-'&``-.,_
&n
&RWelcome to the twisted world of GroundZero.&n

This is not your typical Mud.  Certainly not your typical DikuMUD.  You see,
GZ (as the natives call it) doesn't bother with all that hack-n-slash, roll
or role playing, magic, skills, levels, and classes D&D crap.  Hell, there's
not even the traditional concept of zones and areas.  You see, we're pure,
unadulterated, unapologetic PK.

Now, I know what you're thinking: if there's no magic, no skills, no levels,
no classes, no zones... What is there?  Guns.  And explosives.  And tanks. 
And one helluva' adrenaline rush.

We're not masking our violent tendencies and immature behavior behind
Grokthar the Level 23 Barbarian.  We're bringing it right to the forefront. 
We're rude, we're crude, and we'll definitely try to put a bullet in you. 
As you start out in the game, you're going to start noticing that things are
drastically different from what you've come to expect from Muds.  Some of
the concepts are the same, some of the commands are familiar, some basic
ideas remain; these similarities will only compound the differences into a
potentially confusing and frustrating first play experience.  There's a
significant learning curve: the best way to get over it is by playing and
not getting frustrated.  Still, it'd help to have a more gentle introduction
than what most of our players will want to give you...

That's what this is here for.  So let's get rid of some of those weird,
preconceived notions about what a Mud is and has to be.

First, a Mud doesn't have to have some advanced concept of a character.  In
GZ, a character is a name, a password, and some stats (like how many kills
and how many deaths you've accumulated).  You're not a mage or a cleric or
that weird 33rd class on your favorite Mud that's an awful lot like a mage
or a cleric (but by a different name, of course).  You don't have a
hometown.  You don't have your equipment and possessions saved with you. 
You don't have gold coins.  And you don't have a language.  (People in GZ
speak two languages: English and bad English.) A character in GZ is a player
of GZ.  Nothing more, nothing less.

Second, a Mud doesn't need spells, skills, strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma to differentiate you from another
character.  The difference between you and the next guy is that you suck and
the next guy doesn't, or the next guy sucks and you don't.  The only skills
you have are those you personally have.  You don't sit and type "practice
napalm" to learn how to deliver precise airstrikes, you &Wactually&n practice 
naping people and if you come upon some tactic that works for you, well,
then, you've learned how to deliver precise airstrikes -- that's it, nothing
more complex than that.

Third, a Mud doesn't need meaningful advancement.  Face it, half of you
GoP'ers (Goal Oriented Players, hack-n-slashers) want that next level
because its a status symbol, a way to flaunt your superiority.  GZ doesn't
make you earn experience points by frequenting the same area, killing the
same boring mob a thousand times.  There's no such thing as experience
points, here, bud.  You want the glory and the status of being a good
player?  Then play well.  You kill people more than they kill you, and there
you go, you're at least mediocre.

Fourth, a Mud doesn't need zones.  GZ has a Cartesian plane.  There's an X
coordinate and a Y coordinate and a Z coordinate.  That's where you are in
the game.  The map is autogenerated on every boot.  There are walls in some
places, not walls in others.  The ALPHA base and guardian is in the
northeast corner of the map's top-level, the BRAVO base and guardian is in
the southwest corner of the map's top-level.  Going north adds to your Y
position, going south subtracts from it.  Going east adds to your X
position, going west subtracts from it.  Numbering starts at 0 (this means
that (0,0) is always the southwest corner of any level on the map).

You're starting to come to the realization, now, that GZ is a fairly simple
game.  We try to make things as straightforward as possible.  The game is
syntactically simple.  You start on a team.  The goal is to kill the other
team.  So you're automatically setup to shoot members of the other team if
you have a gun and they're in range.  No need to type KILL BUBBA.  The point
is to kill Bubba.  There's no reason to have your character stand around
with a loaded AK-47 watching Bubba walk around, waiting for you to type KILL
BUBBA.  So if you've got the weapon and Bubba's in your sights, you'll shoot
him.  Don't worry about that.  And if Bubba wants to flee?  He doesn't type
FLEE to run away from combat.  He just fucking runs away.  Combat's not an
intrusive secondary system that requires you to use special commands to get
out of it.  You're getting shot and don't like it, just get the hell out of
the way of the bullets.

So if the game's this conceptually simple, why's there this big learning
curve?  Well, we're syntactically simple, but semantically rich.  All of
these simple concepts can be combined into an infinite variety of tactics. 
And that's where you're going to need play experience to learn.  No-one can
tell you precisely what tactics will or won't work for you.  Experiment. 
Don't worry about dying: there's nothing to lose but your own pride, anyway.

&RNewbie Faq (Frequently Asked Questions)

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do I use explosives?&n
&WA&X:&n See &WHELP PULL&n for how to activate an explosive device.  After you
   have activated the explosive, it's generally a good idea to get rid of
   it.  The obvious way to do that is to drop it.  Perhaps more effective is
   to throw the item -- see &WHELP THROW&n.  There are many tactics relevant
   to explosives, see &WHELP TACTIC1&n for some.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do I shoot someone with my gun?&n
&WA&X:&n Ordinarily, you shoot anyone not on your team that's in your range, as
   well as firing back at people that shoot you.  You can target individuals
   using the &WKILL&n command (see &WHELP KILL&n).

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat happens when I kill someone?&n
&WA&X:&n When you kill someone, your kills are increased by 1.

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat happens when I die?&n
&WA&X:&n Read &WHELP DEATH&n.  Your deaths are increased by 1.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do I dual wield something?&n
&WA&X:&n Type: &WSECOND <weapon>&n to wield something in your off-hand.

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's this small white box with a &Rred&c x?&n
&WA&X:&n The box is a &Rfirst aid kit&n.  To use it, type: &WUSE KIT&n.  It
   will heal you a little, but you can only use the kits once.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do you use these radios?&n
&WA&X:&n See &WHELP RADIOS&n.

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's this droid set do?&n
&WA&X:&n If it's a set for a seeker droid, type: &WUSE SET <victim>&n and
  the droid will hunt the victim down.  If it's a regular droid set,
  type: &WUSE SET&n, and the droid will just kill anything that comes
  nearby.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do I talk to everyone?&n
&WA&X:&n Type: &WCOMMBADGE <blah>&n.  You can abbreviate it to just &WC&n.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do I talk to just my teammates?&n
&WA&X:&n Type: &WTEAM <blah>&n to talk to your teammates.  You can abbreviate
   it to just &W/&n.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow good is this weapon?  Is it better than weapon X?&n
&WA&X:&n Use the &WWPROFILE&n command (see &WHELP WPROFILE&n) to get some
   potentially useful information on weapons.

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's the best weapon in the game?&n
&WA&X:&n There is no one best weapon.  Every weapon has its advantages and
   trade-offs.  Some weapons have specific, narrow purposes, which might not
   be immediately clear.  Play around with them.  You'll figure it out.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow good is this armor?  Is it better than armor X?&n
&WA&X:&n Use the &WCOMPARE&n command to compare them.  It only compares pure
   armor absorption numbers and doesn't factor in other abilities of the
   item (for instance, sunglasses prevent flares from blinding you).

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's the best armor in the game?&n
&WA&X:&n Whatever keeps you alive.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow good is this explosive?  Is it better than exp X?&n
&WA&X:&n Try it out.  We can't tell you &Yeverything&n...

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's the best explosive in the game?&n
&WA&X:&n Probably the belt of 10 grenades.

&WQ&X:&n &cAck!  I'm blind!  What do I do?&n
&WA&X:&n There's little more you can do than wait it out or die.  A good idea,
   if you're on a team, is to try to navigate back to your base (remember,
   the bases are in the northeast and southwest corners, so it's not too
   difficult a task to get back).  The blindness will wear off faster and
   you might even be safe (assuming you have a guardian).  Wear some
   sunglasses next time if you're worried about being blinded, again.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow long does blindness last?&n
&WA&X:&n There's no set time limit.  It wears off when it wears off. 
   There's a better chance of it wearing off when you're in your base.  It
   also goes away automatically when you die.

&WQ&X:&n &cAck!  I'm dazed!  What do I do?&n
&WA&X:&n You're now a sitting duck.  The only thing you can do by yourself
   is wait it out, use an evacuation radio, or try an emergency teleport (an
   emergency teleport hurts you, but it can get you out of a jam; see &WHELP
   TELEPORT&n).  You can also try to get your teammates to &WPUSH&n you out
   of trouble.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow long does daze last?&n
&WA&X:&n There's no set time limit.  It wears off when it wears off or you die.

&WQ&X:&n &cI keep getting killed as soon as I come out!  What do I do?&n
&WA&X:&n Try resting up in safe, first.  You heal much faster in safe,
   sleeping.  If you're just not having good luck with where you're landing,
   try typing &WREPOP&n to toggle between landing just outside of base and
   randomly on the field.

&WQ&X:&n &cPeople keep killing me!  Will they stop and let me get a weapon?&n
&WA&X:&n I wouldn't count on it.  Don't beg your teammates for help -- if they
   can help you, they will.  Chances are, they need help, too, and one
   person hiding and asking for favors won't get your team anywhere.  Try
   working together.

&WQ&X:&n &cThe room's on fire!  It's hurting!  What do I do?&n
&WA&X:&n Move, you flaming retard.  Geez.

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's this, "A mailman runs up to you with an envelope, ..."
   message about?&n
&WA&X:&n You've just received a note.  Type &WNOTE&n to read notes.  There
   are lots of things you can do with the note system.  Type &WHELP NOTE&n if
   you're interested in learning all about it.

&WQ&X:&n &cHow do I send those funny Gocial things?&n
&WA&X:&n With the gocial command.  It works just like regular socials.

&WQ&X:&n &cSomeone's shooting me, but I can't see them on SCAN... What's
going on?
&WA&X:&n He or she is standing outside of your range.  Move out of the way.

&WQ&X:&n &cWho's this Pataki fellow?&n
&WA&X:&n He guards the big red button.  He's a mean sonuvabitch.

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's the button do?&n
&WA&X:&n Starts the core meltdown sequence that ends the round of play.  If your
   team pressed it, you can get kills.  See &WHELP WORTH&n.

&WQ&X:&n &cWho's this enforcer fellow?&n
&WA&X:&n He enforcers certain rules of the game.  Sometimes he'll help out a team
   that is the target of a serious ass-whooping.  Most of the time, you only
   see him when he starts the core meltdown sequence (which is done to give
   everyone a fresh start if no-one's finding the button, etc.).

&WQ&X:&n &cWhat's this about a plane flying overhead and dropping cargo?&n
&WA&X:&n More equipment is being deployed.  This is usually things that are delay
   loaded into the game, such as tanks.

&WQ&X:&n &cA tank!  A tank!  How do I use it?&n
&WA&X:&n See &WHELP VEHICLES&n.  You'll generally want a teammate or two to
   help you, otherwise you'll just be able to drive it around.

&WQ&X:&n &cI have a question that isn't covered here.  How do I submit it?&n
&WA&X:&n Send a note to imm with your submission.  Be sure to mention that
   you're submitting a question to add to the FAQ so we don't think you're just
   asking us a question.  If you have an answer to the question you want to put
   in the FAQ, send that with the question.  We may (or may not) use both.

&WQ&X:&n &cI have some tips to submit to help tips.  How do I do that?&n
&WA&X:&n Send a note to imm with your submission.

-1 MECHS~
&WNAME&n
    mechs - where'd mechs go?  what were they?

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    Mechs were a bright idea.  A single-person vehicle with a nifty heads-up
    display system, the ability to jump (and squash people!), and charging
    up weapon systems for more powerful shots.

    Not too long ago, some people made a big push for Satori to rewrite
    vehicles to be more like GZ1's object vehicles code.  As part of these
    rewrites, he added mechs.  Before then (and now), vehicles were mobiles
    and fully shootable (and damageable) by any weapon.  With the rewrite to
    use object vehicles, tanks and mechs became unshootable.  Satori didn't
    consider this a problem: you could still boom them and he planned on
    adding support for special weapons, like the RPG, for shooting at mechs
    and tanks.

    A lot of people -- most -- liked mechs and weren't bothered by the fact
    that they were basically unshootable; booming them was fairly easy and a
    lot of fun.  While there were a number of legitimate complaints about
    various aspects of mechs, most of these were constructive and dealt with
    in a fairly timely manner by Satori.  On the other hand, there were a
    small, but vocal, number of ingrates who bitched and whined constantly
    about how mechs were unshootable; this despite the repeated explanations
    that mechs could be destroyed with as little as three greenades and that
    the limited ability to shoot mechs was on the way.

    This upset Satori, who had spent a good portion of his time writing the
    mechs and the new vehicle system to meet requests from players to more
    closely match GZ1.  Frustrated, he removed vehicles altogether.

    Tanks are back, these days, but mechs have yet to make their return.
    The vehicle system has been rewritten, again, to be much like it was
    before Satori agreed to change it in the first place.  Since there are a
    few people that miss mechs and want them back, Satori intends to
    eventually update their code to work for the new vehicle system...
~

-1 TANKS VEHICLES~
&WNAME&n
    tanks, vehicles - information on the operation of vehicles

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    NOTE: Some of this information is out of date or wrong!  Vehicles are
    currently in the midst of a re-rewrite.

    GroundZero2 features a small selection of vehicles for your personal or
    team use.  Among them are tanks and mechs.  Both require a minimum of
    one operator.  Their operation is fundamentally similar.

    A mech is a very simple one-person vehicle.  To begin using it, you need
    only enter it using the &cENTER&n command.  Once inside, you are in
    command of the vehicle -- there is no need to issue any special command
    to initialize or start the mech.  To move it, you can either use the
    &cDRIVE&n command followed by a direction, or just the direction itself. 
    The mech's sole weapon is a plasma blaster cannon.  This is a powerful,
    but slow weapon.  You can turn the torso of the mech to point the gun in
    the proper direction using the &cTURN&n command and can fire up to 5
    rooms away using the &cFIRE&n command.

    To turn on a tank, type &cSTART&n.  To turn off a tank, type &cSTOP&n.
    A tank is usually controlled by a team of two people, although you can
    operate it with just one.  To begin using it, you need only enter it using
    the &cENTER&n command.  Once inside, you and anyone else that might be
    inside of it may control it using the commands &cDRIVE&n, &cTURN&n, and &cFIRE&n.
    Usually, you want each person to in charge of one part of the tank's
    operation and to make it easy for that person to use the tank.

0 teleporters emergency deploy redeployment repop~
Syntax: repop
Repop usually refers to where players or items land. It is also 
a command that toggles between random repop and base repop. Random 
repop places you randomly on the battlefield on level 0. Base repop 
allows you to repop you outside your team hq.

Syntax: teleport [emergency]
Occasionally you will find that you are about to get killed and might
wanna get outta dodge in a hurry.  The command teleport was put in for
this very occation.  You just type teleport and you are redeployed
randomly to somewhere on level 0.

To prevent this from being abused (ie transporting right before you get
killed) you must be at full health for it to work.

Also, teleport cannot be used all the time.  The teleport systems 
must be activated and operational.  If they are, and you type teleport, 
you will.  If they aren't you will recieve a message accross your 
comm-badge informing you of some technical problems with the 
transportation systems.  (Also see HELP RADIO)

NOTE: teleport emergency will teleport you at anytime...but will take off
      some HP in doing so because making use of the teleporter when it is
      offline leads to a bumpy ride.

~

0 KMSG SMSG~
Syntax: kmsg <message>
Syntax: smsg <message>
&RKmsg&n is your kill message or what it says after you kill someone. Default is &gCARNAGE!&n
&cHOLY SHIT!&n  Someone(&GFOX&n) just killed Some other guy(&cSOLO&n). <&ryour kmessage here&n>
Smsg is your suicide message or what it says after you kill yourself. Default is What a dumbass!
&cHAHAHA!&n  Someone(&RALPHA&n) died of natural causes.  <&ryour smessage here&n>
~

0 colorlist~

The colors are as follows:

        &YLOWERCASE       UPPERCASE&n
  &&n    Normal              -
  &&x    &xBlack           &XDark Gray&n
  &&r    &rRed             &RBright Red&n
  &&g    &gGreen           &GBright Green&n
  &&y    &yBrown           &YYellow&n
  &&b    &bBlue            &BBright Blue&n
  &&m    &mMagenta         &MBright Magenta&n
  &&c    &cCyan            &CBright Cyan&n
  &&w    &wGray            &WGray&n

These codes replace the old (confusing) GZ color system.  Please update your
titles and other messages as appropriate.

~

0 sockets~

SYNTAX: sockets
SYNTAX: socket <char_name>

This command gives you the site that a person is telnetting from when they
come to play this game.  And it lets players see if someone is multiplaying.
~

-1 DAMAGE~
If ye have a weapon, wield it to kill someone. When ye get another weapon
try it on.

There are many different types of weapons right now on GZ.  Guns and
the like, do damage to 1 target at a time, and you must aim the weapon
at that person (ie, "kill JoeSchmuck").  You will also auto-attack
anyone that opens up at you (makes sense right?).

(See also KILL ALL)

HINT: The closer you are to an explosion the more it hurts! . . . DUH!
~

-1 LD LINK_DEAD LINK_DEATH QUIT EXIT LOGOUT LOGOFF END FINISH~

There is no nice little quit command here because of all the concerns about
people quitting right when they are about to die to avoid losing
KILL_POINTS. There is instead a command called LD which is short for
LINK_DEATH.

This command will leave yer character in the game but disconnect ye so that
ye can go to work/school/eat/sleep/whatever.

By the way, this command is only used by amateurs and weenies. Real players
finish the game.
~


0 ! ^ history~
Syntax:
	! [append...]
	!! [append...]
	!<num> [append...]
	!<text> [append...]
	^<old>^<new>

The ! or !! commands repeat the last command you typed exactly.  You can
reference specific commands in your history by number using the !<num>
format.  For example, "!0" is always the first command in your history.  If
you know the first few letters of the command you want to repeat from your
history, you can repeat the entire command using !<text>.  See the examples
below, since the commands are highly intuitive once you see them in action.

If you follow !, !!, !<num>, or !<text> with a space and a string, the
result is the history entry with the string appended to it.  See the
examples.

The ^<old>^<new> command replaces the text <old> with the text <new> in the
last command you typed.

The HISTORY command shows the history of the commands you typed.  The
history size is typically rather small (around 10).  You can use this
command to see what commands are in what position in your history so you can
reference them using the !<num> command.

Examples:

  > history
     0  tell sat
     1  'Hello, world.
     2  'Goodbye.
     3  who
     4  history

  > !0 Hey
  You tell Satori '&rHey&n'

  > !1
  You say '&usHello, world.&n'

  > !2  Actually, nevermind.
  You say '&usGoodbye.  Actually, nevermind.&n'

  > tell satroi Hey, man.
  They aren't here.

  > ^satroi^satori
  You tell Satori '2Hey, man.&n'

These commands provide some means for people without advanced Mud clients to
compete with those that use such clients.

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.

0 DROP GET GIVE TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: give <object> <character>

DROP drops an object on the ground.

GET gets an object from the ground.
TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object to another character.

DROP, GET and TAKE understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
 Don't forget to put the  .  between the all and the <object>.

See also: LOAD UNLOAD
~

0 LOAD UNLOAD ammo shells clips guns rockets launchers~

You can't shoot an empty gun, so don't forget to load your ammo!

Load by itself will load the weapon that you are wielding with whatever
ammo is available.  If you want to load it with something in particular,
you may type load hollow for example to load hollow tip bullets.

You can UNLOAD a clip to replace with a better ammo, or a full clip.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY GEAR~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
GEAR is a way cooler word for EQUIPMENT.
~

-1 FLEE RETREAT~

On most muds, if you are fighting, you can't run away.  You have
to flee and wait to see if you were successful or not.  Not here!
If you are attacked either kill the bastard or run like hell!

(i.e. there is no flee command)
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <weapon>
Syntax: examine <weapon>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is a combined 'LOOK weapon' and  'LOOK IN weapon'.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points.
However, you are weak as a baby when you REST, and SLEEP is the
closest thing to DEATH!

Use STAND or WAKE to stand at attention.  You can also WAKE other slacking 
(SLEEPING) characters.
~

0 GTELL REPLY SAY TELL~

Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL is
replaced with team channels (see help on blue and red).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote 
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will 
work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.
This is handy for talking to hidden or switched immortal players.
~

0 NOTE NOTES~
The notes replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other muds.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list       : show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read       : either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove     : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of

writing new notes:
note to         : sets the to line for a new note (name, immortal, or all)
note subject    : sets the subject for a new note
note +          : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note -          : removes last line of note
note clear      : erase a note in progress
note show       : shows the note you are working on
note type       : set the type of the note (QOTD, SOTD, or general)
note post       : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

other commands:
note revise     : load in a note you previously wrote to edit it
note flags      : (Imm) set flags on a note (nodelete, etc.)

The 'note list' command has several options that can be used to specify what
type of notes you want to list.  The default is to list all notes, except
those that have been flagged as "stupid" by the immortals.  You can see all
of the notes, including stupid ones, by typing 'note list -a'.  The options
to the 'note list' command are:

  -a              Display notes of all types.
  -z              Clear the default display types list. (Display none.)
  -dtypes         Display notes of types <types>.
  -ntypes         Do not display notes of types <types>.

Note types are represented by a single character.  The following types of
notes are available:

  +               Smart.
  -               Stupid.  
  g               General (a message that isn't flagged anything else).
  n               New-only (messages newer than the last one you read).
  o               Old (-dn is -no, -nn is -do)
  q               Quote Of The Day (QOTD).
  s               Site Of The Day (SOTD).
  u               Urgent.
  x               NoDelete (a message that doesn't get date-purged).

For instance, to display all stupid and smart notes, but no others, you'd
type something akin to:

  > note list -z -d+-

To display all notes except stupid, QOTD, and SOTD ones, you'd type:

  > note list -nqs-

The new-only message type is special in that specifying -dn will cause only
messages of that type (new) to be shown, while -nn will allow any message,
new or old, to be shown.  This is slightly different from other flags, but
probably more intuitive than specifying that you don't want to see old
flags.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. 
Type note read to scroll through them one at a time.
~

0 EMOTE SOCIAL socials GOCIAL gemote~
Syntax :
	emote <action>
     socials
     gocial <social>

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.
Socials can be added with the sadd command as well.

If you want to perform a social on someone who is not in the same room 
with you, use GOCIAL before the social, and it will be broadcast to
the entire game.  
~

-1 REMOVE WEAR HOLD~
Syntax :
     remove <object>
     remove all
     wear <object>
     wear all
     hold <object>
     
WEAR is for armor.
REMOVE will let you stop using something.
HOLD will hold some items in your free hand, except for weapons.

-1 MAP BATTLEMAP RADAR LEGEND HUD SCANNERS~
&WNAME&n
    map, battlemap, radar, hud, scanners, legend - an eagle eye's view of
      your surroundings

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    It is often times beneficial to see the entire map or just your
    surroundings graphically.  By doing so, you can see where players and
    mobiles are on the map, what team they're on, where mechs and tanks
    are, fire, darkness, and gas, and so forth.

    There are three styles of maps in the game: the entire map as seen from
    outside it (as you would see with &cLOOK MAP&n in your base), the entire
    map as seen inside it (as you see by using a portable battlemap with &cUSE
    BATTLEMAP&n), and your surrounding area ("radar" as it is sometimes called
    -- a better name might be "scanners"), as you would see with the heads-up
    display (HUD) in a mech or with a special visor object as you move around.

    NOTE: This last type of map is currently disabled and does not appear in
    GZ2.  The mech code, to which it was attached, went out the door when
    vehicles were re-rewritten -- a rewrite is necessary to bring these
    features back.  See &cHELP MECH&n for more information.

    The maps don't differ in the symbols and colors they use too much.  The
    main difference is the sort of information they show.  In fact, the only
    difference between the map you see via a portable battlemap and the one
    you would see from inside your base is that portable battlemaps mark
    your location.  If you're not on the field, the view from inside the
    base and from a portable battlemap is exactly the same.  Below are the
    symbols that are used for any style of map.  Bear in mind that not all
    will appear in a map you're looking at as some are dependent upon the
    map style.

&WLEGEND&n
    The following symbols are used on some, or all, of the maps:

      &Y*&n - your current location (on "radar", your mech's location).
      &RF&n - fire
      &XD&n - darkness
      &GG&n - gas
      &n.&n - nothing of interest/scannable there
      &X:&n - outside of scanner range or map
      &YM&n - a mine you own or your team owns
      &gR&n - an inactive/unoccupied mech
      &gV&n - an inactive/unoccupied tank
      &Y?&n - a potential mine (see NOTES, below)
      &WD&n - a first down (see NOTES, below)
      &G$&n - an obvious depot (see NOTES, below)

    Players appear as the first letter of their team capitalized and in the
    color of their team; mobiles appear as the first letter of their team
    lowercase and in the color of their team.  Occupied mechs and tanks
    appear in the color of their occupant's team.  These are general rules
    because their may be more, less, or different teams depending upon the
    scenario and the whim of the administrators.  In the default scenario,
    these rules give rise to:

      &BB&n - Team BRAVO player
      &RA&n - Team ALPHA player
      &cS&n - SOLO player
      &XT&n - TRAITOR player
      &Bb&n - Team BRAVO mobile
      &Ra&n - Team ALPHA mobile
      &cs&n - SOLO mobile
      &Xt&n - TRAITOR mobile
      &BR&n - Team BRAVO mech
      &RR&n - Team ALPHA mech
      &cR&n - SOLO mech
      &XR&n - TRAITOR mech
      &RV&n - Team ALPHA tank
      &cV&n - SOLO tank
      &XV&n - TRAITOR tank

    If you're not sure what a symbol is, chances are it's a player or
    mobile.  Try to see if there's any teams which have the same starting
    letter and color.

&WNOTES&n

    The special symbols &Y?&n, &WD&n, and &G$&n only appear when your team
    locates a potential mine, first down, or obvious depot.  That is, if one
    of your teammates walks over a square that has a first down, is a depot,
    or is mined (of course, they need to have a metal detector in use at the
    time -- if they hit the mine, it'll cease to be there), then the map
    will take note of the fact.  Mines can disappear from the map when one
    of your teammates discovers the square is clear of mines (which might
    happen when your teammate hits the mine or when he walks over the square
    after someone else has hit the mine).

    The potential mine symbol (&Y?&n) is used because the mine can be
    cleared without you knowing about it, and thus it's possible (though not
    always likely) that it's safe to walk over a square that's marked as a
    potential mine.

    Down exit and depot symbols are cleared from the map on expansion, since
    both change with the map.

-1 HYPOSPRAY~
&WNAME&n
    hypospray - those weird things that work backwards

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    Hypospray seems to work backwards.  If you &cUSE&n it, it hurts you.  If
    you are hit by it exploding, it heals you.

    This is not a bug.

    Use this to your advantage.

-1 COOKING~
&WNAME&n
    cooking - reducing the time on explosives

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    It's often beneficial to have an explosive with a reduced timer on it.
    In the absence of C4, the only way to reduce the time it takes an
    explosive to go off is using a method called 'cooking' the explosive.

    To cook an explosive, you simply &cPULL&n it as per normal, let some
    time tick off, and then &cUNPULL&n (&cREPIN&n or &cDEACTIVATE&n are also
    acceptable) it.  Be careful, though!  You can only cook so much time off
    of an explosive before the failsafe prevents you from stopping it again,
    and there's a fair chance that you can fail (and need to try again) or
    have a critical miss (causing the explosive to blow up immediately).

    For more information on cooking, see &cHELP UNPULL&n.

-1 UNPULL DEACTIVATE REPIN~
&WNAME&n
    unpull, deactivate, repin - stop the countdown on explosives

&WSYNOPSIS&n
    &cunpull &X<&nexplosive&X>&n
    &cdeactive &X<&nexplosive&X>&n
    &crepin &X<&nexplosive&X>&n

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    If you have pulled an item, you can stop the countdown on it using the
    &cUNPULL&n command.  You cannot stop the counter on items that you did
    not activate.

    The primary use of this is in cooking time off of explosives, see &cHELP
    COOKING&n.  It may also be useful to conserve explosives if the target of
    your boom has fled.
~


-1 EXPLOSIVES BOMBS GRENADES C4~
&WNAME&n
    explosives, bombs - brief intro to explosives and explosions

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    Sometimes you won't be able to get something done with a gun.  Or you
    won't want to.  For instance, you might be severely out-gunned by an
    opponent.

    Never fear.  You're not at a complete loss or disadvantage.  GZ has
    explosives which form an integral part of the game and allow for a
    variety of interesting, effective tactics against even the best armored
    and defended player!

    Explosives come in several different forms.  You start the game with an
    explosive, in fact: a grenade.  The typical way you use any explosive is
    with the &cPULL&n command.  That will activate the counter on the
    explosive.  Once the countdown has started, you need to do something
    with it.  Generally, you won't want to hold onto a live explosive for
    very long (there are some cases where you might want to, though, see
    &cHELP HYPOSPRAY&n).  You can either toss the item or drop it.  Either
    way, you should get well clear of the ensuing explosion!

    There are many different types of explosives.  But all are very easy to
    use: the general interface is through &cPULL&n.  More interesting is the
    sheer variety of tactics that explosives lend themselves to.  No-one can
    enumerate all of the ways in which you can employ explosives to get a
    job down and only experience will reveal what methods work best for you. 
    A good introduction, nonetheless, is provided in Tireg's Booming
    tutorial (&cHELP TACTIC1&n).

-1 PULL ACTIVATE LIGHT~
&WNAME&n
    pull, activate, light - activate an explosive device

&WSYNOPSIS&n
    &cpull &X<&call&X|&nexplosive&X> [&ntimer&X]&n
    &clight &X<&call&X|&nexplosive&X> [&ntimer&X]&n
    &cactivate &X<&call&X|&nexplosive&X> [&ntimer&X]&n

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    The &cPULL&n command activates the countdown on an explosive.  When you
    pull an explosive, you normally have 10 seconds before it explodes. 
    There are several situations in which the time before the explosion
    will be more or less than 10 seconds:

      &Y* &nIf the explosive has been "cooked".  See &cHELP COOKING&n.
      &Y* &nIf the explosive has a timer on it that has been set.

    Some explosives have a timer on them which can be set by providing an
    initial value after the name of the object.  C4 is the typical example
    of an explosive with a timer.  You can specify the number of seconds
    within a particular range before the C4 will explode.

    The &cLIGHT&n and &cACTIVATE&n commands are synonymous with &cPULL&n.  Some
    people might prefer to use &cLIGHT&n with objects that are lit on fire,
    &cACTIVATE&n with timer devices, and &cPULL&n with grenades.  These people
    are silly and will be easy targets for you.

&WEXAMPLES&n
    Pull a single grenade:
      &X> &npull grenade

    Pull all grenades in your inventory:
      &X> &npull all.grenade

    Set some C4 up to explode in 30 seconds:
      &X> &npull c4 30

-1 MINE BURY~
&WNAME&n
    bury - bury a mine

&WSYNOPSIS&n
   &cbury &X[&nmine&X] [&ndirection&X]&n

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    If you have a mine or encounter one lying on the ground, you can bury it
    using the &cbury&n command.  When a mine is buried, it is hidden in the
    room and may be tripped by someone walking through.  Mines can do many
    interesting things, here, including blinding (flare mines), stunning
    (stun mines), and hurting (claymore and AP).  The variety makes mines an
    important and broad tool for your defense.

    Most mines are tripped (set off) when a person enters the room that the
    mine is set in.  There are a few exceptions.  Early Dection System mines
    are only set off when the opposition enters the room it's set in. 
    Claymore mines are directional -- you specify what direction the mine
    should be set in and when someone leaves in or comes from that
    direction, the mine is set off.

    The EDS is the &Wonly&n mine which has protection for you and your
    teammates.  Otherwise, you and your team are just as succeptable to your
    mines as everyone else.  This means that's it's usually a good idea to
    avoid excessive mining, to not mine near your own base, and try to keep
    your mines in easy to remember locations so your teammates don't
    accidentally hit them.  When you bury a mine, your team is automatically
    informed of where you placed it, but don't think that's sufficient to
    keep them from hitting them.  When mines are laid in abundance or in
    seemingly random locations, your team may forget about them or walk into
    them without realizing it (until it's too late, anyway).

&WEXAMPLES&n
    To bury a claymore mine, set to the east:
      &X> &nbury clay e

    To bury the first mine in the room:
      &X> &nbury

    To bury the first mine in the room, set to the north, if it's a
    directional mine:
      &X> &nbury n

0 SHOOT KILL COMBAT~
Ahhhhhhh . . . so you want to kill someone eh?

KILL <whoever>
SHOOT <whoever>

The game will automatically have you shoot them the next time they are in
range and you have a weapon working correctly.

KILL ALL
SHOOT ALL

Fuck em'.  You'll kill anything that gets close as long as it's
not on your team.

KILL 
SHOOT

With no argument, this will stop you from killing your target.
~

-1 THROW TOSS~

Syntax :
	throw	<obj_name>	<distance_&_direction>
	throw	<obj_name>	<player_name>

This command is used to throw an object up to 2 squares away from yerself.
There is really no practical value to it unless ye are throwing a live
explosive. Thus it is usually used right after the PULL command. You are,
however, not limited to only throwing live explosives.
~


0 USE~

SYNTAX: use <object_name>
SYNTAX: use <object_name> <argument>
When in doubt as to how to use an item, try the USE command!!!
Works with radios among other things.
~

0 DEPRESS BUTTON~

When you find the &RBIG RED BUTTON&n which just so happens to be hooked to the
nuclear device which will destroy everyone in the city and give you and 
your team credit for all the kills that your team has gotten for this game
, you might get the urge to DEPRESS it to start the countdown sequence.

To do this you type "depress button" and WOW it starts the sequence.  
All you have to do now is stop everyone else from getting to it and 
pushing it themselves.  Don't you hate people who push your buttons?

~


-1 BUG IDEA TYPO~

Syntax :
	idea	<message>
	type	<message>

These commands will take yer message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.

~

0 DELETE~
 So ya wanna delete yourself, eh?  Well, just type 'delete' twice and 
 poof! Yer character's gone!  That's all to it!  But be warned, you'll
 have to create a new character or use another character if you want 
 to play again.

-1 COMMANDS~
&WNAME&n
    commands - show the available game commands

&WSSYNOPSIS&n
    &ccommands &X[&c-table&X|&c-count&X|&nname&X]

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    With no arguments, the &WCOMMANDS&n command will simply list most of the
    interesting commands in the game with a very short description of what
    the command does and how it can be used.

    With an argument of &c-table&n, the command will show the complete table
    of commands (this is the old behavior of the &WCOMMANDS&n command).

    With an argument of &c-count&n, the command will simply count the number
    of commands in the command table.

    All other arguments are taken as textual arguments and are prefix
    matched against entries in the command synopses table.  All matching
    entries and their short descriptions are shown (if any).  Since this
    command does prefix matching, it is possible to use it to list all
    commands that begin with 'a', then all commands that begin with 'b',
    etc., so that you can split it up in parts or look for a command whose
    full name you don't remember (e.g., &Bcommands a&n lists all commands
    that begin with 'a').
~


-1 REPORT SCORE TIME~

Syntax :
	report
	score
	time

REPORT announces yer current statistics to anyone who is in the same room
as yerself.

SCORE tells ye a little about yourself (hours played, armor absorption,
etc.)

TIME shows the time this game was last started and the current system
time. If nobody pushes the &RBIG RED BUTTON&n within 2.5 hours of the 
last reboot, then the enforcer will push the &RBIG RED BUTTON&n and 
initiate the destruction sequence.
~


0 WHO~
Syntax : who

WHO shows the people currently in the game, and what team they're on.

The "players that might give you some trouble" are the characters who are 
connected to the game.  The "players that won't know what hit them" are those 
that have lost link.
You are STRONGLY encouraged to kill the LD ones cuz they just take up space
and their equipment could be put to much better use than sitting on them when
they are link dead.

"who immortal" lists all immortals playing
"who blue" and who red list the characters on the red and blue teams.
"who hunter" lists players who are on neither (immortals and bounty hunters).
~


-1 WHERE~


Syntax :
	where
	where	<character>

WHERE without an argument tells ye the location of visible players 
in the same area as ye are.

WHERE with an argument tells ye the location of one character with
that name anywhere in the world.
~


-1 HELP~

Syntax :
	help
	help	<keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.
~


-1 DESCRIPTION~

If anyone is close enough to look at ye -- WASTE 'EM!
~


-1 PASSWORD~


Syntax :
	password	<old-password>	<new-password>

PASSWORD changes the password for yer character. The first argument must be
yer old password. The second  argument is yer new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~


-1 TITLE~

Syntax :
	title	<string>

The game supplies a default title when yer character is created. Ye can
use TITLE to set your title to pretty much anything of yer choosing.

-1 WIELD PRIMARY SECONDARY~
&WNAME&n
    wield, primary, secondary - wielding weapons

&WSYNOPSIS&n
    &cwield &X<&B_&X|&nweapon&X> &X[&B_&X|&nweapon&X]&n
    &cprimary &X<&nweapon&X>&n
    &csecondary &X<&nweapon&X>&n

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    The &cWIELD&n command is the general way to wield a weapon.  The typical
    usage is with the name of the item you want to wield.  You can specify
    two items to wield one in your primary and one in your secondary hand. 
    There's no benefit to wielding a particular item in one hand or the
    other, so you shouldn't fret over the order.  The special item name &B_&n
    means, "none."  Using &B_&n you can use wield to only try to wield to your
    second hand.  Omitting a second weapon is the same as specifying &B_&n for
    it.

    You can use the &cPRIMARY&n command to wield to your primary hand.  It's
    roughly like, but not exactly equivalent to,

      &X> &nwield obj

    The difference is that if the object cannot be used in your primary hand for
    whatever reason, it will not attempt to use your second hand at all and will
    remove your primary weapon if need be.

    The &cSECONDARY&n command is like the &cPRIMARY&n command, except that it uses
    your second hand.  It is roughly like, but not exactly equivalent to,

      &X> &nwield _ obj

&WEXAMPLES&n
    To dual wield two 9mm pistols:
      &X> &nwield 9mm 9mm

    To wield a 9mm in your second hand:
      &X> &nsecondary 9mm

    Or:
      &X> &nwield _ 9mm

-1 WPROFILE WEAPONS GUNS~
&WNAME&n
    wprofile - see a weapon profile

&WSYNOPSIS&n
    &cwprofile &X<&nweapon name&X>

&WNOTE&n
    This command has been replaced by the generalized &cPROFILE&n command.  Help
    is not yet available for the &cPROFILE&n command, but is forthcoming.  In
    the meantime, you can usually get the same results here by using &cPROFILE
    &X<&nweapon name&X> &cGUN&n to only look for items with the given name and 'gun'
    in their keywords list.

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    If you're not sure what ammo a particular weapon takes or how much
    damage it does, you can see its profile with the &cWPROFILE&n command.
    The command shows some of the following information:

      &Y*&n Ammo Type
      &Y*&n Max Ammo
      &Y*&n Range
      &Y*&n Rounds per Second
      &Y*&n Rate of Fire
      &Y*&n Damage Multiplier
      &Y*&n Approxiamate Damage per Combat Round
      &Y*&n Handedness

    Some information will be omitted for weapons where it is not applicable.

&WFIELD MEANINGS&n
    &BAmmo Type&n is the type of ammo the weapon takes.  This is generally not
    the name of any particular ammo/clip object, but a general description
    that will help you identify the proper ammo objects for your weapon of
    choice.  This field will be omitted if the weapon does not take ammo.

    &BMax Ammo&n is the amount of the ammo the weapon can have in it, at
    maximum.  This is generally calculated by finding the ammo object that
    has the largest capacity.  Note that not all ammo objects will have this
    much ammo.

    &BRange&n is how far the weapon can reach.  If it is zero, it can only
    reach the current room.  Any number above zero, X, implies a range of X
    rooms.  Thus, a weapon with range 1 can fire in the current room and 1
    room away in any direction.

    &BRounds per Second&n is the number of ammo rounds the weapon will fire in
    a single combat round (1 second).  This is omitted when the weapon fires
    slower than once per combat round.

    &BDelay&n is how many seconds of delay there is between firing the weapon.
    This simulates weapons with "burst triggers," where they could have a
    slow rate of fire, but still fire short, quick bursts.  (This was
    formerly called, "rate of fire," but too many people confused it with
    RPS.)

    &BDamage Multiplier&n is a real number that modifies the damage numbers
    provided by the ammo of the weapon (the ammo is what normally determines
    the majority of a weapon's damage).

    &BApproxiamate Damage&n is a range.  The lowerbound is computed using
    the weakest available ammo and assuming the opponent has 200 abs.  The
    upperbound is computed using the strongest available ammo and assuming
    the opponent has 0 abs.  This gives you an approxiamate range for the
    amount of damage a weapon &Wcan&n deal.  It is not guaranteed to be
    accurate.

    &BHandedness&n specifies how the weapon can be wielded.  The available
    values are &Wsecondable&n meaning that you can both &cWIELD&n and
    &cSECOND&n the weapon (meaning you can use two of them at the same time,
    e.g., dual automatic pistols); &Weither&n meaning that you can use the
    weapon in either hand, but can only dual wield it with a weapon that is
    explicitly &Weither (dualable)&n (e.g., you can use it in either hand
    and dual wield it with all but two-handed weapons), and &Wtwo-handed&n
    meaning that the weapon takes up both hands and thus cannot be dual
    wielded.

Fixed issue with hyposprays causing damage rather than healing it.

CHANGE LOG ARCHIVES:
&Y* &cHELP CHANGES_ARCHIVE_2&n for September 2001 to December 2001.
&Y* &cHELP CHANGES_ARCHIVE_1&n for February 2001 to September 2001.

&X--&n/ &W21 Aug 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fixed crash with tanking mobiles (why'd this happen?!).

&X--&n/ &W11 Aug 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fixed tank ammo.
sat&Y*&n Added &cTURN&n command to turn the turret (if you're manning the
     turret, though, you can just type a direction like always).
sat&Y*&n Made it possible for people to tank alone by using &cFIRE&n/&cTURN&n.
sat&Y*&n Added &cFIRE&n delay.
sat&Y*&n Fixed tank's turret's range so it can fire.
sat&Y*&n Auditing the code for stack overflow.
sat&Y*&n Fixed mixed-up messages on some &cSET&n fields.
sat&Y*&n Added &cNOSOCIALS&n command to ignore socials/gocials.
sat&Y*&n Undid dumb decision to lag &cSCAN&n as much as &cTRACK&n.
sat&Y*&n Added &cAUTOSCAN&n feature to scan while walking.  I'm not sure if I
     like the idea of it or not, so it may disappear.
sat&Y*&n Fixed a crash bug in expansions that hit us twice, yesterday.  :(
sat&Y*&n Added &cNOSKULLS&n command to turn off spammy skull on death.
sat&Y*&n Upgraded to GCC 3.0.4.

&X--&n/ &W09 Aug 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Added the &cFIRE&n command.  With it, the turret station for tanks
     has changed.  You still turn the turret to face a direction using the
     normal movement commands, but now you must manually fire the turret by
     typing &cF &X[&ndistance&X]&n.  Correct documentation on the tank will be
     forthcoming.
sat&Y*&n Some tweaks to defeat bots/clients.
sat&Y*&n Base map now keeps track of (obvious) depots.
sat&Y*&n Slightly updated &cHELP MAP&n.
sat&Y*&n Clear depot and down base map flags on expansion.
sat&Y*&n Let mobiles run arbitrary commands on birth.

&X--&n/ &W08 Aug 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n New character &cSET&n fields for imms.
sat&Y*&n Fixed MCCP compression error on warm reboot bug.
sat&Y*&n Fixed tank bug where its weapons were flipped.

&X--&n/ &W20 Jun 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n &cTEAMWHO&n command added.
sat&Y*&n Score-contributing kills statistic added.
sat&Y*&n Fixed a crash bug with killing multiple clones of the same mobile;
     it was extremely unlikely to be caused by ordinary circumstances, but
     easily triggered by admins fooling around -- which probably means it was
     more likely to occur, given our staff.
sat&Y*&n Removed enforcer healing guardians.
sat&Y*&n Removed enforcer repopping guardians.
sat&Y*&n Audited the code for memory leaks; none existed.  (Despite the fact
     that I think I'm a competent coder and have fixed much of the GZ2 code,
     this genuinely surprised me.  I figured GZ2 would be riddled with
     memory problems due to careless additions and subtractions over the
     many years of GZ and GZ2 development.  I was wrong, which makes me
     somewhat proud.)
sat&Y*&n Major development semi-frozen on this branch.  See below.

&YIMPORTANT NOTICE&X: &nMajor development is no longer expected to continue on
this version of GZ2, although bug fixes, minor feature enhancements, and the
completion of existing code will still be tended to.  I have branched off a
separate version to do more extensive rennovation and rewrites.

&X--&n/ &W25 May 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Removed Death in accordance with 2 May 2002 poll results.
sat&Y*&n Trying a smaller L1 to see how it works out.

&X--&n/ &W02 May 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Slowed down death since pathfinding is really (too) good, now.
sat&Y*&n Considering removal of Death -- see poll.
sat&Y*&n Blindness/darkness no longer hides people from 'who', just from
     the map.

&X--&n/ &W01 May 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Mobile pathfinding now uses an augmented BFS.

&X--&n/ &W23 Apr 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n &cCOLORSET&n command added to configure color scheme.

&X--&n/ &W22 Apr 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

lal&Y*&n Added satellite objects for seing topological map of L0.
sat&Y*&n Astounded to see someone else's name in the changelog. :)

&X--&n/ &W20 Apr 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fixed an annoying bug where you could suddenly dual wield stuff
     that you shouldn't have been able to.  The cause of the bug eluded me
     for the longest time, but then I found it: someone (maybe me in a
     misguided late night hack?) changed the wear_flags to a sh_int (16 bits)
     from an int (32 bits), which meant that we'd lose the last wear flag,
     ITEM_TWO_HANDED -- the 17th bit flag.  (Obviously, one can't set 17 bits
     in a 16 bit integer.)

&X--&n/ &W06 Apr 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Added &cNOTE BLOCK&n to enter a text block editor.
sat&Y*&n Added very simple, no frills block editor.
sat&Y*&n Tanks have a secondary weapon for 4-man tankers.
sat&Y*&n Added code for items that hurt passersby.
sat&Y*&n Added code for items that slow passersby.
sat&Y*&n Added code for items that spawn items with the above behavior.
sat&Y*&n Added 'box of nails' item to game.  &cUSE&n and walk carefully.

&X--&n/ &W31 Mar 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Added general object profiling command &cPROFILE&n.
sat&Y*&n Removed redundant &cWPROFILE&n command.
sat&Y*&n Removed redundant, worthless &cCOMPARE&n command.
sat&Y*&n -- New help files for PROFILE not written, yet.

&X--&n/ &W29 Mar 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Mortals now have the &cGEMOTE&n (global emote) command.
sat&Y*&n Mortals can now see the list of bans with &CBAN&n command.
sat&Y*&n Rewrote banning code altogether.
sat&Y*&n Date sorted ban list.

&X--&n/ &W21 Feb 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fiddled with load averages and damage for mines.
sat&Y*&n Tweaked mobiles that chase people (medics, marines, etc.) to try to
     get out of dead-ends.
sat&Y*&n Added absolute value to marine target distance check to prevent
     alpha marines from seeking southwest out of range.  (I don't know how
     this slipped by unnoticed for so long.)

&X--&n/ &W19 Feb 2002 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n On death, newbies get reset to full HP.  Novices get set to
     half HP.  The rest of us schmucks get the same ol', same ol'.
sat&Y*&n Added &cTOP DEATHS&n and &cTOP HOURS&n to keep track of those
     who play a lot.  And those who die a lot.

sat&Y*&n New immortal convenience commands for dubbing and deletion.

sat&Y*&n TELNET SGA option support.
sat&Y*&n TELNET integration with MCCP2 bug fix.
sat&Y*&n Another MCCP2 bug fix.
sat&Y*&n MCCP2 bug fix.
sat&Y*&n TELNET NAWS subnegotiation parsing fix.

&X--&n/ &W04 Dec 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n More color fixes.  Keep the reports of ugly/bad colors coming in.
sat&Y*&n Restricted some codes from mortals (clear screen, flash, etc.).
sat&Y*&n Removed MCCP v1 support on suspicion that it was causing problems
     with Zmud users.
sat&Y*&n Reset colors in greeting to fix login color bugs.
sat&Y*&n Some (ugly as sin) colors in the greeting.  I'll fix it to be more

sat&Y*&n Some under the hood changes for output processing.
sat&Y*&n Fixed minor TELNET negotiation bug.

&X--&n/ &W03 Dec 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Tried compensating for Zmud "ANSI" emulation bugs.
sat&Y*&n Tried compensating for Gmud "ANSI" emulation bugs.
sat&Y*&n Added some internal codes for clear screen, etc.
sat&Y*&n Automagically converted most color codes in the game.
sat&Y*&n Automagically converted player files for new configurable colors.
     The configurable colors are still lacking an interface (for now).
sat&Y*&n Wrote and migrated to a completely new color system.

&X--&n/ &W02 Dec 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Upgraded gcc and system libraries.

&X--&n/ &W21 Oct 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

     fire.
sat&Y*&n Added &BXX&n and &Blevel&n keywords to frag grenades.
sat&Y*&n Fixed display bug with &cCLONE&n.
sat&Y*&n Fixed bug with barrels not setting off mines.

&X--&n/ &W15 Oct 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fixed minor crash bug in an imm command.
sat&Y*&n Added imm command &cTOPOLOGY&n which shows a detailed map of a
     level (complete with walls).  Mainly for when I fuck around with the
     map generator, but it looks neat.

&X--&n/ &W05 Oct 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n I removed some of the L0 mobs for the time being.  It seemed way
     too busy on the map at the game start.  Let's see how things work out
     with some of the annoying, pointless mobs gone.  We can always bring
     them back later, if desired.
sat&Y*&n The health scanner was renamed "lifeforce scanner" as in GZ1.
sat&Y*&n A few help files added for some common things people try to get
     help on (for whatever reason): blind, daze, stun, bases, teams, alpha,
     bravo, etc.
sat&Y*&n Immortals have more control over spacing in their title.
sat&Y*&n Fire extinguishers don't load as much, but spread out so that they
     put out fires in adjacent rooms.
sat&Y*&n More kits load (but there's not more in the game: I reduced the
     number of medics per team to 1).
sat&Y*&n Certain objects get destroyed by fire now (such as gas barrels).
sat&Y*&n Prettied up the note arrival message.

&X--&n/ &W23 Sep 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fixed changelog archival so that current shows, rather than most
     recent archive.
sat&Y*&n An escape character (ESC) in the middle of a line causes all
     previous input on the line to be ignored, so that you can issue a new
     command in the middle of typing something else.

&X--&n/ &W3 Sep 2001 &n/&X-------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Added a &cMAKECHAR&n command for imms.
sat&Y*&n Archived old changelog information in CHANGES_ARCHIVE_1, type
     &cHELP CHANGES_ARCHIVE_1&n for the old stuff dated Feb to Jul of 2001.

&X--&n/ &W3 Jul 2001 &n/&X-------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Changed &cWEAR&n to act like &cWIELD&n (I didn't want to, but...)
sat&Y*&n Fixed a bug in &cWIELD&n so, say, 'wield 9mm 9mm' while you were
     already wielding a manhunter wouldn't remove the manhunter, wield one
     of the 9mms, then wield the manhunter again. (It wasn't looking for
     the secondary object until after it had removed your primary weapon,
     if any.)
sat&Y*&n &cCOMMANDS&n command changed to display short synopses of commands.
lou&Y*&n Submitted short descriptions for many of the commands.
sat&Y*&n &cCOMMANDS -TABLE&n added to mimic the old behavior of &cCOMANDS&n.
sat&Y*&n &cCOMMANDS -COUNT&n added to count all the commands you can access.
sat&Y*&n Made some output paginate more nicely (e.g., &cCOMMANDS&n output).
sat&Y*&n Wrote a new help file for &cCOMMANDS&n.

&X--&n/ &W25/26 Jun 2001 &n/&X---------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Pagination bugs fixed.  Login sequence simplified because of this.
sat&Y*&n New newbie help files.  Added and fixed FAQ.  See &cHELP NEWBIE&n
     and &cHELP FAQ&n.
sat&Y*&n Newbie help file now shown when newbies login.
sat&Y*&n FAQ and tips submission info provided in FAQ.
sat&Y*&n Better multiplayer logging.
sat&Y*&n Some code reorganization.
sat&Y*&n Some color code fixes and reorganization.  New code `\_ to do &`.
sat&Y*&n Secondary gun added to tanks.
sat&Y*&n Tank interior description and capacity set.
sat&Y*&n Tanks no longer drive through walls when you're just driving them.
     You can follow the directional command with a '!' to force the tank to
     drive through a wall (if it can, anyway).
sat&Y*&n &cKILL&n (shoot, etc.) now requires a '!' to target teammates if
     you're on a regular team (e.g., not SOLO/TRAITOR/etc.).  For instance,
     &cKILL BUBBA!&n if Bubba's on your team.
sat&Y*&n &cTELE!&n is now a synonym for &cTELEPORT EMERGENCY&n (tele e).

&X--&n/ &W24 Jun 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Delayed loading of tanks (and, potentially, other objects) added.
     Tanks will be dropped off 15 minutes into the game.
sat&Y*&n &cPAGE&n command added to send people pages.  &cBEEPS&n command
     added to toggle the beep sound when you get a page.  Pages are stored
     when they're sent to you if you're in quiet mode, linkdead, or just not
     in the game.  This provides a quick alternative to writing private
     notes.  I need to write a help file for this, eventually.  (Or someone
     write one up and send it to me for a small reward.)

&X--&n/ &W11 Jun 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Advanced command history and substitution added, see &cHELP !&n.
sat&Y*&n A badly written social (e.g., &cPRES&n) can longer cause a crash.
sat&Y*&n Fixed the &cPRES&n social, since whoever wrote it obviously didn't
     know how to use the substitution codes to insert the proper names (he
     used the victim name code in the no-arguments version of the social,
     duh!).

&X--&n/ &W02 Jun 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n New urgent notes now automatically listed when you login.
sat&Y*&n Added 'n' note type for "new-only" (-dn would display only new
     notes, -nn displays both old and new notes).
sat&Y*&n Added test object for scope (attaches to koch/auto only for now)
     that when &cATTACH&ned to a weapon, gives added range.  You can also
     &cDETACH&n an item from a weapon.
sat&Y*&n &cMAN&n gives a little bit more information when displaying the
     stations available in a vehicle.
sat&Y*&n Fixed a little bug with &cNOTE LIST&n options.
sat&Y*&n Claymore mines are now directional, see &cHELP BURY&n.
sat&Y*&n New note help is in, see &cHELP NOTE&n.
sat&Y*&n New vehicle stuff coming along nicely, now -- should be finished
     Real Soon Now(tm).

&X--&n/ &W30 May 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Mechs temporarily removed to make way for sweeping vehicle code
     changes.
sat&Y*&n &cNOTE REVISE&n added to let you revise a note.
sat&Y*&n Some clean-ups and (very) old bugs fixed.  One, in fact, was as old
     as Ground Zero, itself (so 5+ years old).

&X--&n/ &W29 May 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n &cNOTE -&n added to remove last added line to a note.
sat&Y*&n &cNOTE FLAGS&n added for immortals to set flags on notes.
sat&Y*&n &cNOTE LIST&n accepts flags to list types of notes.
sat&Y*&n &cNOTE TYPE&n added to allow identifying QOTDs/SOTDs.
sat&Y*&n &WCaveat:&n The additions to the note system are not yet fully
     documented.  I'll be getting to that very shortly.

&X--&n/ &W12 Apr 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Droids and turrets are no longer vulnerable to stunning or gas.
sat&Y*&n Pataki is no longer vulnerable to gas.

&X--&n/ &W03 Mar 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Traitors get the -2k HP penalty for the duration of their
     traitorhood.

&X--&n/ &W02 Mar 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n You can now &cROLL&n barrels.  They'll go as far in one direction
     as they can.  Comments about whether there should be a cap on the
     distance of this or some other penalty for rolling are welcomed.  Right
     now it introduces a short amount of lag for rolling (extremely minor).
sat&Y*&n Blindness now has a better chance of wearing off in your base.
sat&Y*&n Fixed losing team button reward (it was reporting +10 and doing +5,
     it now gives +10 *AND* reports +10 :).

&X--&n/ &W25 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Can see where people in mechs/tanks are on &cWHERE&n.
sat&Y*&n &cWHERE ALL&n shows where all characters on current level are.
sat&Y*&n &cWHERE 2.MEDIC&n, etc., works (previously you could only use
     &cWHERE&n on only the first character that matched the desired name).
sat&Y*&n Tracking a player in a mech/tank works.
sat&Y*&n Flamethrowers leave a trail of fire through the rooms they shoot.
     Damage on them weakened a bit to account for the fire damage.  I bumped
     up butane fuel capacity, too, to make it a usuable weapon.
sat&Y*&n Bug introduced in &cWHERE&n earlier this morning fixed.
sat&Y*&n &cSHOWVOL&n command to show volunteers to your team.
sat&Y*&n &cBOOM&n command given to MERCs and up, per Snipper's suggestion.
sat&Y*&n Tear gas bombs now leave a trail of poison gas when fired with ZX.
sat&Y*&n Long-standing &cTOP KILLS&n reversion bug fixed, should start
     updating and eventually be accurate again.

&X--&n/ &W24 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Safe volunteering mode and guardian respawns when one team's
     dominating the other.  Report any fuckiness you see with this,
     since I can't test it very well by myself, and it's a relatively
     new idea that I went over with a few players earlier today.
sat&Y*&n Volunteering to a team without a leader will let you in
     automatically.
sat&Y*&n You can't volunteer if you're the only person on your team.
sat&Y*&n The losing team now gets a +10 bonus to worth for winning the
     button.

&X--&n/ &W23 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Mines and nape that was mis-credited fixed.
sat&Y*&n Minor bug with zombified players logging in fixed.
sat&Y*&n A bug with &cJUMP&n and mech's hitting mines fixed.
sat&Y*&n A few other minor glitches and bugs fixed.
sat&Y*&n s/Wakizashi/Wakazashi/ -- Musashi's "Book of Five Rings" says
     'wakazashi', other sources say 'wakizashi'.  I'll go with Musashi
     just about any day.

&X--&n/ &W21 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Fixed character garbage collection that was causing lockups (the mud
     was trying to reap zombies for linkdead inactivity -- killing zombies
     [which are characters waiting to lose ownership on objects in the game
     so they can be safely extracted] is a bad idea).
sat&Y*&n After some instability over the past two days, the mud should now be
     at least as stable as it was before and, hopefully, even more so.
sat&Y*&n Maps updated.  See &cHELP MAP&n.
sat&Y*&n &cSCAN&n now sees mechs/tanks around you.

&X--&n/ &W20 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Wrote &cHELP MECH&n and &cHELP TANK&n (they're the same)
sat&Y*&n I fucked some things up and then fixed them.
sat&Y*&n Charging for mechs is a bit slower.
sat&Y*&n Mechs are a bit weaker.
sat&Y*&n &cJUMP&n command for mechs.
sat&Y*&n Fixed a problem where the mech charge messages were wrong.

&X--&n/ &W19 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n Old-style tanks and mechs are in for testing.
sat&Y*&n Mechs now have a HUD/radar/scanners-eye view of things.
sat&Y*&n No longer need to startup a mech/tank, just enter.
sat&Y*&n &cDRIVE&n, &cTURN&n, and &cFIRE&n commands in for using tanks
     and mechs.  There's very little documentation, yet.
sat&Y*&n Hopefully fixed some weirdness with mobiles.
sat&Y*&n Smarter character garbage collection.  When someone owns objects,
     they won't be extracted right away.  This fixes the problems with
     mines getting mis-attributed and the long-standing (but well-loved)
     problem with "(null)" killing people.  Never fear, (null) still makes
     an occassion appearance, as per my instructions.  :)

&X--&n/ &W18 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

tir&Y*&n Mobiles that throw exp back at you.
sat&Y*&n AP mines now do more character and less structure damage in
     relation to Claymores.  This means that Claymores and APs have
     definite, separate purposes.  An AP does more character damage, a
     Claymore does more damage to items.  A good understanding and careful
     use of this knowledge will produce better results with mining.
sat&Y*&n Removed GeneralSavage and made Death slower.  Fine.  You, "Make it
     easier to find second," happy now?  Go and make me do something I don't
     wanna.  :(
sat&Y*&n ARES upgraded to take the place of now gone Panther assault cannon.
sat&Y*&n Katana, wakizashi, and metal shank melee weapons in.
sat&Y*&n Load numbers adjusted for some weapons.

&X--&n/ &W16 Feb 2001 &n/&X------------------------------------&n

sat&Y*&n &cWEAR&n and &cWIELD&n have changed.  (Preliminary)
sat&Y*&n &cSECOND&n changed to &cSECONDARY&n.
sat&Y*&n &cPRIMARY&n introduced (like &cSECONDARY&n).
sat&Y*&n Now any one-handed weapon can be used in either your primary or
     secondary hand.  It doesn't matter which.

-1 QTI QUANTUM "QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY, INC." TELELOCATOR TELERAN TELE-EXP~
a &WQTI &bT&Be&cl`$e&cR&Ba&bn&n grenade
a &WQTI &BTele&cLocator&n grenade

These explosives from Quantum Technology, Inc. lead the field, employing
bleeding edge quantum teleportation techniques in a reliable, small, and
useful package.  QTI grenades come in two varieties:

&WThe TeleRan grenade&n is a grenade device that, upon exploding, teleports
those in its immediate vicinity to a random location.  The TeleRan is useful
for quickly clearing out areas that are too densely populated to be taken by
force.

&WThe TeleLocator grenade&n is very similar to the TeleRan grenade, except
that rather than teleporting its victims away, it teleports its owner to the
location of the explosion.  The TeleLocator can be used to escape a boom but
come right back afterwards to finish off a fight safely.  There are many
other strategies you can employ using the TeleLocator.  Just be careful with
it.  It's very easy to teleport yourself into a boom if you don't plan well.

Both are used as ordinary explosive devices.  The primary interface is via
the &YPULL&n command.  See &cHELP PULL&n.
~


-1 STORYLINE~

Right now the story is simple.  You're alive.  You must kill everyone.

~


-1 ENFORCER~
The enforcer is a special mobile with limited administrative abilities who
performs certain tasks within the game.  Most often, the enforcer is seen
performing various automated tasks, such as depressing the button after a
round of play has gone on for too long (about 2 hours) or when one team has
become too much of a dominating presence.
~


-1 ADMINISTRATOR GOD IMMORTAL ~
Administrators are the guys who make the game run, keep the players inline,
and mercilessly manipulate the feeble player base of the game to their own
less-than-virtuous ends.  Or something like that.  In theory, anyway.  In
reality, they just sit around and make fun of the players.  It's easier than
doing any real work.
~


-1 IMOTD~
&n
I hate having to press ENTER to scroll past the IMOTD and MOTD.  Bleh.
  -satori

~


-1 FOLLOW~
Syntax: follow <argument>

To follow someone type follow and then their name.
Follow by itself turns on and off whether people can follow you.
Your default follow state is off.
Even when on, only teammates can follow you.
~


-1 KP KILL_POINTS KILLS~

KILLS  K: - How many people you have killed.
DEATHS D: - How many times you have died.

When you reach 1,000 kills you become a Merc and are able to go SOLO. 
If you are SOLO, you get 1 HP every time you kill another player.  
You also lose 1 HP every time you are killed by another player.   
There is no limit to the amount of HP you can gain by killing, 
but you can only go as low as 5000 HP. 

Merc = 1,000 kills
Hunter = 5,000 kills
Badass = 10,000 kills

The more Kills a player has, the more Kills they are worth when you 
snuff them. Being a Merc, Hunter or Badass does not entitle you to 
any special priveleges, other than the ability to go SOLO.

~


-1 COMMBADGE GOSSIP CHAT OOC TALK BOUNTY~

You can communicate to everyone in the game using the COMMBADGE command.
              
                 Ex:  comm I'm gonna kill you all!

You would see:   &WYou &R&XCOMMBADGE&n: &W I'm gonna kill you all!&n
~


-1 CONFIG AUTO CHANT PRACTICE TRAIN CAST~

What do you think this is, a MUD?  No.  It's GroundZero! There is no such
thing as training or casting spells. The only practicing you will be doing
is practicing how to PKILL.

~


0 BOOT TRAITOR~
Syntax: boot <whoever> <reason for booting>
Team members screwing everything up? Killing other team members? 
If you're not the leader, the only thing you can do is bitch about 
it. But, if you are the leader, then you can use the boot command 
to remove the bastard from your team. But you better have a good 
reason for booting them or you'll be noleadered.
~


-1 LEADER RESIGN~

A Leader is the first player on the team with over 1000 kills.  This
is usually someone who has a great deal of experience as a player and
may offer help to others in the team.  

The leader is also responsible for getting the team together to take
out the other teams and plan to capture and depress the button.  Of
course, your leader may be a complete asshole and not give a damn,
and in that case, you're just stuck with him/her.

&cLEADER COMMANDS&n:
&Wresign&n [&Xteammate&n]
A leader can also use the resign command to shift leadership to a
teammate with minimum ranking of MERC.  Without a specific person
the person with the highest rank is picked by default.

&Wboot&n <&Wvictim&n> <&Wreason&n>
Got a jackass on yer team that's killin' teammates?  Or helping the
other team?  Maybe he needs to get a haircut?  And he's using AOL?
Boot the fucker and get him off yer team.  Note: You MUST provide
a valid reason for traitoring somebody.. failure to do so may result
in your being declared an unfit leader.
~

0 RANKS MERC HUNTER BADASS JOSH NOVICE DUMBASS~
Watch out for these guys. Hunters and Badasses can hide their kills/deaths.
Badasses also get '&Wexplode&n' and '&Wboom&n' commands. Explode sets off all
the explosives in your inventory without the long wait. Boom explodes everything 
in your inventory and also disconnects you.  You have to have max hp for
either of them to work though...

JOSH-               the lowest rank, but has some special abilities
DUMBASS-            a bad rank, nothing special, here
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOVICE    250+      kills
MERC-     1000+     kills
HUNTER-   5000-9999 kills and a 2:1 ratio
BADASS-   10000+    kills and a 2:1 ratio

~

-1 OBJECTIVE~

Kill everyone that is not on your team. Find the down exit that leads to 
level 2, kill the mobs that are guarding the BIG RED BUTTON.
Depress the button before the other team does. 
~

-1 CROSSFIRE~

Be careful when wandering near a gunfight.  
You may get caught in the crossfire!

~

-1 SOLO~

SOLO players have over 1000 kills and don't feel like playing with the team.
They can kill whoever they want and do what they want.  Fear them.

-1 SPAMKILL~

Spamkilling is the act of repeatedly killing the same player over 
and over just to piss them off.  
~

-1 boom~
Boom is when you gather lots of explosives and blow something up!

Also see:  Help tactic1
~

-1 team~

There are two teams on GroundZero: The Second Coming.
The ALPHA team, whose base is located at the northeast corner
of the map (20, 20), and the BRAVO team, whose base is located
at the southwest corner of the map (0, 0).

The TEAM command is used to communicate with your team.
Just type team (message) to use.
~

-1 LEVEL~

   There are three levels on this mud.  The first level (0) is
usually where everybody is.  You can go down (first down) to
the second level (1) where mobs will try to stop you.  You can
go down (second down) again to the last level (2), where
Pataki is.  Kill him and you can depress (help depress) the
button!
~

-1 COMMBADGE~

    You have a commbadge which can send messages to the whole
mud.  Just commbadge (message) to do so.
~
-1 BOOM EXPLODE~

Syntax: BOOM
Syntax: EXPLODE

The EXPLODE and BOOM commands do nearly the same thing.  The EXPLODE command
will instantly explode all items in your inventory.  It only works when you
have full HP.  It is also restricted to BADASSes.  The BOOM command calls
EXPLODE but also logs you off.  This means it works as a very quick and
efficient version of PULL ALL followed by LD.  It is guaranteed to kill you,
even if you didn't have enough exp to finish yourself off.

~

-1 WORTH~
The worth shown before the team scores on 'who' is the average of the scores
of all the active teams (all those teams for whom scores are shown).  It is
awarded to the team that depresses the button.

~

-1 DEPOT~
Depots are where ammo repops after being used up or fragged. There are
always three depots in the game. One of them is always at the center of the
map, figure it out. The other one is randomly generated by the game after a
reboot. The third is at 20 minus (x coord of random depot), 20 minus (y
coord of random depot). For example, if the random depot happens to be at 3,
3, then the other depot is at 17 17.
~

-1 CENSOR~
Syntax: censor <password>

Little baby getting offended by the other players' language? If you are, you
shouldn't even be here! But... being such a great MUD, we offer a command to
block out that nasty language. With, censor, any explicit language will be
blocked.

~


-1 RADIO AIRFORCE BACKUP EVAC~
Syntax: use air <x> <y> 0
Syntax: use backup <x> <y> 0
Syntax: use backup
Syntax: use evac <x> <y> 0

AIRFORCE RADIOS patch you through to the bombers above and provides them
with a target for where their explosive payload is to be dropped. Covers a
3x3 room area with fiery death.

BACKUP RADIOS sends 3 troopers to wherever on level 0 or follow you around.

EVAC RADIOS transports you to any spot on level 0 in a flash.

Note: you can leave out the level 0 at the end if you are on level 0.

~

-1 time update~
TIME shows the time this game was last started and the current system time.
If nobody pushes the BIG RED BUTTON(see help button) within 90 minutes of
the last reboot, then the enforcer will push the BIG RED BUTTON and initiate
the destruction sequence.

~


10 TODO_HELP~
update help admins,
take out credits from the help list,
replace it with tactics maybe take out help contest and other helps not in
use on the help list? add these to help leader: induct resign volunteer,
also have help induct volunteer, and resign lead to help leader OR put it in
a seperate help file and put a (see help induct, etc) in the help leader

~

-1 INDUCT VOLUNTEER RESIGN~
Syntax: volunteer <team>
Syntax: induct <target>
Syntax: resign [new leader]

If you want to defect to another team, you can VOLUNTEER to that team. If
the leader INDUCTS you, then you're in. Tired of being leader? You can use
the RESIGN command to bestow the leadership upon another team member worthy
of it.  You can either choose a specific team member to hand over control to
or, with no argument, have the game auto-select a new leader.

~

-1 TIPS~
These tips are provided by the admin and players of GZ.  They're probably of
most utility to newbies.  Feel free to submit your own tips by writing a
note to imm with your submission(s).  Be sure to put somewhere in the note
that you're submitting tips, so we don't think you've just sent us some
random information.

&Y-&n 'L' for load, 'LOO' for look, because loading is so much more important

&Y- &GCLICK!&n means you're out of ammo, type load or just 'L'

&Y- &nIf it ticks, get rid of it, quick! You can drop it and run or toss it 1-2
  rooms in the 4 cardinal directions(see help toss). It will tick 10 times
  before it explodes but some explosives explode when it hits the ground
  after being tossed.

&Y- &nThe 9mm pistol isn't very strong, find something to replace it quick!

&Y- &nNever just stand there, keep moving, this isn't one of those MUDs where
  you just type kill (whoever) and stand there waiting for them to die.

&Y- &nTry to stay on L0(level 0 or the main level, see help level), don't go
  down, a few tough mobs down there.

&Y- &nDon't go near the enemy team's guardian. BRAVO team base and guardian at
  [ 0,  0] L - 0. ALPHA team base and guardian at [20, 20] L - 0.
  Guardians have a range of four rooms, figure it out.  See HELP BASES.

&Y- &nCheck inside your hq or base for donations.  See HELP DONATE.

&Y- &nThere is always three ammo depots in the game, one of them is always 10,
  10 (when the map is not expanded or retracted, as might happen in a
  scenario or because of the sheer number of people).  See HELP DEPOT.

&Y- &nWatch out for MERCs, HUNTERs, and especially BADASSes.  See HELP RANK.

&Y- &nLearn to run and pick up stuff at the same time.

&Y- &nTry to stay out of rooms with gas or fire, keep moving around until you
  get out.

&Y- &nOnly type as much as you need to.  All commands and item names can be
  abbreviated, usually down to 1 or 2 characters.  The only time you'll
  need to type out more is to disambiguate the reference.  If there's a
  "barrel of gasoline" and a "grenade" in the room, to be sure of what
  you're referring to, use "ga" for gasoline and "gr" for grenade; if
  there's just the grenade, "g" will suffice.

&Y- &nSlowness and inefficiency kills.  Use the abbreviations extensively.
  Instead of GET GRENADE, use G G or G GR.  Instead of THROW C4 2 NORTH
  use T C4 2 N.  It looks confusing at first, but you'll get used to it
  with a bit of practice.  And you'll really appreciate it when you're
  under a real time crunch.

&Y- &nUse TEAM to talk to your team members and COMM to talk to everyone else.

&Y- &nKeep trying, don't give up, if you have to, use the suicide booming
  technique, grab a whole bunch of exp, pull all, then run towards your
  target. Don't be discouraged by a few deaths.

&Y- &nFaor more tactics, see help TACTIC

~

-1 CONVENTIONS~
&WNAME&n
    conventions - an overview of helpfile conventions

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    The following are the conventions that should be used throughout most of
    GZ2's help files.  If you find a file that should conform to these
    conventions but does not, please report them to an administrator,
    preferably with a note (see &cHELP NOTE&n).

    Some files are not required to follow these conventions.  Help files on
    specific items, such as explosives or weapons, special text messages
    such as changes/motd/imotd/credits, FAQs, tutorials, and guides are the
    main special cases.

&WMajor Headings&n
    Headings in help files always appear as unindented, all-caps, and in
    bright white.  An example is &WNAME&n above.  Headings mark the beginning
    of a particular section of a help file.  There are a few standard
    headings that will typically appear:

      &Y* &WNAME&X -&n the name of the current help file and a brief description
      &Y* &WDESCRIPTION&X -&n a long description of the help file
      &Y* &WSYNTAX&X -&n if this is a command, its syntax description
      &Y* &WSEE ALSO&X -&n references to other commands/help files
      &Y* &WEXAMPLES&X -&n examples of the command or concept

    Different help files will have different combinations of these.  For
    commands, you will usually find the headings in this order:

      &Y* &WNAME&n
      &Y* &WSYNTAX&n
      &Y* &WDESCRIPTION&n
      &Y* &WEXAMPLES&n
      &Y* &WSEE ALSO&n

    The body of a heading will be in standard gray and indented 4 spaces
    from the beginning of a line.

&WMinor Headings&n
    Minor headings indicate subsections of a help file.  They are in bright
    white, standard capitalization.  An example is &WMajor Headings&n above.
    What minor headings appear in a help file is dependent upon the help
    file itself.

&WBody of Sections and Subsections&n
    The body of a section or subsection is indented 4 spaces and written in
    standard gray text.

&WBulleted Lists&n
    Bulleted lists are sometimes used in the body of a section or
    subsection.  A bulleted list is indented 2 additional spaces from the
    current indentation level.  The bullet is yellow and the list item is
    typically standard gray (but may be different depending upon what is
    being listed).  The standard bullet is an asterisk.  Examples of a
    typical list can be seen above in the &WMajor Headings&n subsection.

    Lists may be nested within each other.  In which case, the sublist is
    indented 2 spaces and the bullet is changed.  The progression of
    bullets: &Y*&n, &Yo&n, &Y+&n, &Y-&n, and &Y.&n.  Beyond that, there's no
    preferred method of bulleting and so any may be chosen.  An example of a
    nested list:

      &Y*&n Fruit
        &Yo&n Apple
        &Yo&n Orange
        &Yo&n Mango
      &Y*&n Vegetable
        &Yo&n Carrot
        &Yo&n Cucumber
        &Yo&n Celery

    Nested lists should be fairly rare.

&WSection and Subsection References&n
    Within the body of a section, subsection, list, or sublist, a reference
    to a section should appear in bright white with the capitalization of
    the section or subsection.  For instance, "&WMinor Headings&n" is a
    reference to the subsection entitled "Minor Headings."

&WLiterals&n
    Literal commands (e.g., things that should be typed as they are shown)
    are in cyan and all-caps.  For instance, &cHELP CONVENTIONS&n.

&WSymbolic Punctuators&n
    In some cases, symbolic punctuators will be in dark gray.  This is
    normally down in syntax descriptions, examples, or see also bodies to
    de-emphasize the presence of the symbol as a means of indicating that it
    should not be typed but its meaning should be obeyed.  In some cases,
    symbolic punctuators are used strictly for visual separation of two
    quantities, as is the case in see also bodies.

&WSyntax Descriptions&n
    The syntax of a GZ2 command is described in a regular way.  The command
    first appears as a literal, in lower-case, cyan, followed by a
    description of what arguments it may take, if any.  Within a syntax
    description, &X<>&n surrounds a required argument and &X[]&n surrounds an
    optional argument.  &X|&n indicates a choice between several arguments.
    Lower-case cyan text indicates literals, standard gray text indicates
    variable quantities (e.g., things you should provide).  An example:

      &cfoobaz &X<&call&X|&nweapon&X> &X[&narg2&X]&n

    In the above, the command is &cfoobaz&n and it requires one argument that
    may either be the literal word "all" or some quantity &Bweapon&n that you
    provide.  (Generally, the arguments are named such that it's clear what
    you should provide for it.  In this case, &Bweapon&n probably refers to the
    name of a weapon.)  It also takes an optional argument, &Barg2&n.

&WArgument References&n
    A reference to a provided argument is in lowercase, blue.  An example
    can be seen with &Barg2&n in &WSyntax Descriptions&n.  In cases where an
    argument has a choice between a literal and a quantity, the argument
    reference refers to that slot, whether it be the literal or user
    quantity.  For instance, the description for &cFOOBAZ&n might say
    something like:

      If &Bweapon&n is &call&n, then &cFOOBAZ&n operates on all weapons it can
      find.  Otherwise, you should provide the name of a weapon for &cFOOBAZ&n to
      operate on.

&WSEE ALSO&n

The level should normally be -1.  If the help file is for administrators
only, use their trust level.  Level 0 is reserved.

The topic names is a list of space separated words by which this help file
can be referred to.  It honors quotation marks, thus &c"A B C"&n is considered
one word, and &cA B C&n is considered three.  You should avoid using quotation
marks for your topic names, since it can introduce confusion and make a help
file with a partial match of the name impossible to read.

-1 BLINDNESS FLARE SUNGLASSES~

Blindness is an effect of several weapons and explosives.  The flare gun,
for instance, blinds people.  Blindness can be prevented by wearing
sunglasses.  If you're wearing sunglasses, you can't wear earmuffs, a gas
mask, or a helmet.  This means that for protection from blindness, you're
vulnerable to stun, poison gas, and regular damage.  Everything's a
trade-off.

When you're blind, you can't see, so you can't shoot people and you can't
see where you're going (but you can still move around, just it's made a bit
more difficult).  If you're on a team, the best thing to do when you're
blind is to get back to base.  You can do this either by turning on repops
at base and using the teleporters (&WHELP TELEPORTERS&n) or by trying to
navigate your way to it.  Navigating while blind can be difficult,
especially if you don't remember where you were when you were blind.  The
bases are still easy to find, though, since they're in the extreme corners
of the map.  If you're trying to go to bravo base, just try going as much
southwest as possible -- if &WENTER HQ&n fails, you're not in the southwest
corner, so a room with no south or west exits, so try going around the
walls.

Once inside your base, blindness has a better chance of wearing off.
Blindness, like daze (&WHELP STUN&n), lasts until it wears off or you die:
there's no time limit or, even, range of times.  It could last a second or
for the rest of the round (provided you don't die, which would take quite
some doing).

-1 STUN DAZE EARMUFFS TASER SONIC~

Stun/daze is an effect of several weapons and explosives.  The taser, for
instance, stuns people.  Stun can be prevented by wearing earmuffs (don't
ask why: it doesn't make much sense in the case of the taser -- it's just a
game).  If you're wearing earmuffs, you can't wear sunglasses, a gas mask,
or a helmet.  This means that for protection from stun, you're vulnerable to
blindness, poison gas, and regular damage.  Everything's a trade-off.

When you're stunned or dazed, you can't move around (but you can still
manage to shoot, so you're not completely defenseless -- again, it's just a
game).  If you find that you're dazed, you don't have much you can do about
it yourself except wait it out.  Daze, like blindness (&WHELP BLIND&n),
lasts until it wears off or you die: there's no set time limit or, even,
range of times.  It could last a second or for the rest of the round
(provided you don't die, which would take quite some doing).  Note that you
can't use the &WENTER&n command while dazed.

If you're on a team, you can try getting your teammates to push you around
to safety.  Alternatively, if the teleporters are on, you can simply
teleport around (&WHELP TELEPORTERS&n).  If the teleporters are off, you
can still use &WTELEPORT EMERGENCY&n to teleport, but it hurts, so be
careful.
~

-1 DRIVE~

Driving a vehicle is just like moving around.  Once the vehicle is activate,
just move around.  It's as simple as that.
~

-1 FIRE~

Fires are started by napalm strikes, some explosives, and some weapons. 
When you're standing in it, fire hurts you.  Thus: don't stand in fire (do
you really need to be told this?).  If you're killed by a fire, the person
that started it gets credit for killing you.  Fires go away after a little
while, depending upon what started them (from being rather quick flash fires
as with incendiary shotgun shells all the way up to being gasoline fires). 
You can put fires out with a fire extinguisher.  Simply type &WUSE
EXTINGUISHER&n.
~

-1 "KILL ALL"~

The &WKILL ALL&n command is used to enable automatically targetting players
not on your own team.  This is the default for all players.  You can turn it
off by simply typing &WKILL&n (you won't attack anyone unless they attack
you) or &WKILL &ctarget&n where &ctarget&n is someone you want to kill (you won't
attack anyone but that person).

Unless you know exactly what you're doing and why, it's usually a good idea
to leave 'kill all' on.
~

-1 BEEPS PAGE~

&WBEEPS&n toggles whether or not you hear audible beeps on your terminal.

&WPAGE&n allows you to send a private message to someone that beeps and can
be stored up.  Type &WPAGE&n with no arguments for how to use the command.
~

-1 MAN~
&WNAME&n
    man - manning positions in a vehicle

&WSYNOPSIS&n
    &cman&n
    &cman &X<&nposition&X>&n

&WDESCRIPTION&n
    You can use the &BMAN&n command to man a position in a vehicle with
    several stations, such as a tank.  To see the stations available in a
    particular vehicle, simply type &BMAN&n with no arguments.  To take
    control of a station, type &BMAN &X<&nstation&X>&n where &X<&nstation&X>&n
    is the desired station.

    Two people cannot man the same station.  Whoever was their first gets to
    stay.  You can stop manning a position by typing &BMAN&n.

&WSEE ALSO&n
    &cHELP VEHICLE&n - general help for vehicles
~

-1 DROIDS SEEKER TURRET LX-810T LX810T~

A seeker droid is a droid which hunts down a target and attacks it in an
attempt to kill it.  Whoever owns the droid gets credit for the kill.  These
droids come from "seeker droid sets" and are constructed using the &WUSE&n
command like: &cUSE DROID SATORI&n.  This will set the droid after Satori.

An LX-810T turret is another sort of droid.  This one simply sits still and
attacks.  Whoever owns the turret gets credit for any of its kills.  These
turrets come from "LX-810T construction sets" and are constructed using the
&WUSE&n command like: &cUSE TURRET&n.  The turret does not take an argument
for who to attack like droids: they simply attack anyone not on their team.
~

-1 AIM~

You don't need to aim.  It's a text game, bub.  You can target specific
people with &cKILL &X<&nperson&X>&n where &X<&nperson&X>&n is the person
you want to target, &cKILL ALL&n to shoot at anyone in range that's not on
your team (this is the default), or &cKILL&n to not shoot at anyone, except
people that shoot you.
~

-1 SCOPE ATTACH~

A scope is an object that can be attached to a weapon to increase range. 
Certain scopes only work for certain weapons.  Try the &cATTACH&n command to
attach them, like &cATTACH SCOPE 9mm&n to attach the scope to a 9mm.
~

-1 RELOAD~

To reload a weapon, just type &WLOAD&n.  Why should the command be
different?
~

-1 ALPHA BRAVO TEAMS~

ALPHA and BRAVO are teams.  When you login, you're assigned to one or the
other depending upon the game's balance at the time.  No one is
"permanently" a bravo or alpha, so don't get too attached to the labels. 
Your goal, as a team member, is to help your team win the game.  See &WHELP
BUTTON&n.
~

-1 "WALL SET" WALL~

You can setup walls using a wall set.  Use the &WUSE&n command to do, as in,
&WUSE WALL N&n to make a wall to the north.  There are some restrictions
that become apparent when you try them.
~

-1 CHANNELS COMMUNICATIONS~

The main way you talk on GZ is with the &WCOMMBADGE&n command.  You can
abbreviate it to &WC&n.  This talks to everyone on.  You can use the
&WTEAMTALK&n (abbreviated &WTEAM&n or &W/&n) to talk to just your team, or
&WTELL&n to talk a particular person.
~

-1 BASES~

A good place to hide is your team's base.  The bases are normally in the
southwest and northeast corners, one for each of the two regularly active
teams.  In some scenarios there may be as many as 4 active teams, with four
bases in each of the corners.  Traditionally, the two active teams are BRAVO
and ALPHA, with BRAVO's base being in the southwest corner (0, 0) and
ALPHA's in the northeast corner (20, 20).  The guardians stand on the bases,
pushing away people not on the same team who walk onto them, as well as
shooting them with a grenade launcher.  A guardian's range is usually 4
squares.  Thus, if you're on BRAVO team you should stay well-away from the
ALPHA base, as the guardians are pretty mean.

Sometimes not even your base will save you!  Each base starts with a
guardian to protect it.  The guardian is big and strong.  There's no way a
player can stand in and fight with the guardian one-on-one.  However,
guardians can be killed.  Either through repeated booming, using a tank, or
standing outside his range with a long-range weapon.  Since the guardian has
to stand at your base to protect against other teams gaining entry, he
cannot defend against these tactics.  Without your help, the guardian will
die and nothing will stop the other team from getting into your base.  This
means that donations and hiding players are not safe there.

Inside the base, you can use the &WLOOK MAP&n command to see the battle map. 
See &WHELP BATTLEMAP&n for more on that.  Also, blindness has a better
chance of wearing off once inside base.
